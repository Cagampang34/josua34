       <h4>Watching Anime</h4>

    <div class="box2">
        <p>Watching anime has been one of the source of joy and fascination in my life, with one particular series standing out the most, the goat in all of anime. The greatest anime of all time in my opinion, One piece.
            Created by the genius mind of Eiichiro Oda, One Piece has not only captured my imagination but has also become a cornerstone of my love for animated storytelling. 
        </p>
        <p>What i loved the most about One Piece are the characters. The characters in One Piece are not just ink and color on the screen; they are living, breathing entities with personalities that resonate deeply. Luffy's unyielding determination, Zoro's unwavering loyalty, Nami's strategic brilliance, and the list goes on. 
            I am grateful for the unforgettable  experiences, stories, and quotes that have become an part of my life.

        <h4>Playing Sepak Takraw</h4>
     <div class="box3">
        <p>This unique sport, also known as the "kick volleyball" of Southeast Asia. The uniqueness of the sport drew me towards it.
            The sport not only challenged me physically but also provided a mental workout as It honed my strategic thinking and coordination skills. 
        </p>
        <p>While my skills in Sepak Takraw may still be in the budding stage, the journey has not been without its challenges. Learning to balance on one leg for powerful kicks, perfecting the delicate touch required for precise passes, and adapting to the fast-paced nature of the game.</p>
